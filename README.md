## Technology

This project was built with Javascript and [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/).   
We used [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) and [Enzyme](https://github.com/airbnb/enzyme) testing frameworks. Jest provides test coverage as well.   
[ESLint](https://github.com/Intellicode/eslint-plugin-react-native) has been set up as a style checking.

## User Stories

### MVP

```
As a user,
so I know where to inject,
I want the app to generate a suggestion.

As a user,
so I know the last injection site,
I want to be able to see this.
